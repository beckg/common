common routines for other projects

Probably should use some infrastructure packages - but I have been using these for a number of years, and they have one or two useful features.

I am not a great fan of Eclipse and other IDEs - I find a simple editor and make (nmake) adequate. 
If you want to use a makefile, then you will need to tweak the JAVA_HOME setting; if you prefer IDEs, 
then you know how to import the code into a project.
